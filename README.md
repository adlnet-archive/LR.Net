# LR.Net

LR.Net is a client library for the [Learning Registry](http://github.com/LearningRegistry/LearningRegistry.git) project. It is written in C# and provides basic access to a Learning Registry node. Currently, `obtain`, `publish`, and `harvest` are supported, with plans to implement `slice` in the near future.

This library is still in active development. If you encounter a bug, please file an issue to let me know what needs to be fixed.

## Supported Platforms

This library has been successfully compiled for use with the .Net Framework 4.0 and Mono 2.10.8. It works under  *Windows XP/Vista/7* and *OS X*, and should also run under linux as well (currently untested).
